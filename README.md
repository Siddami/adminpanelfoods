## Challenges Faced

- **Sidebar Layout:**  
  Ensuring the sidebar does not overlap the main content, especially with fixed positioning and responsive design. Required careful use of Tailwind‚Äôs flex/grid utilities and conditional margins.

- **TypeScript & Recharts:**  
  Typing Recharts payloads and custom tooltip/legend components was tricky due to the library‚Äôs loose types.

- **Global Styles:**  
  Some global CSS (like `#root` styles) conflicted with the dashboard layout and needed to be adjusted or removed.

- **Next.js App Directory:**  
  Handling client/server component boundaries, especially for context and hooks, required using `"use client"` and correct imports.
